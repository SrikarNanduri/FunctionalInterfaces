 Functions are exactly same as predicates except that functions can return any type of result
   but function should (can) return only one value and that value can be any type as per our
   requirement.
 To implement functions we implement Function interface in 1.8version.
 Function interface present in Java.util.function package.
 Functional interface contains only one method i.e., apply()

 interface function(T,R) {

   public R apply(T t);

  }
