Sometimes our requirement is we have to get some value based on some operation like

supply some data like some object or some collection etc

For this type of requirements we go for Supplier. Supplier can be used to supply items (objects).

Supplier won't take any input and it will always supply objects. Supplier Functional Interface contains only one method get().

interface Supplier<R>  {
      public R get();
        }

Supplier Functional interface does not contain any default and static methods.
