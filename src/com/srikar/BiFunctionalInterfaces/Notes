Need of Two-Argument is where (Bi) Functional Interfaces comes into picture.

Normal Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Function and Consumer) can accept only one input argument.
But sometimes our programming requirement is to accept two input arguments, then we should go for two-argument functional interfaces.
The following functional interfaces can take 2 input arguments.

1. BiPredicate
2. BiFunction
3. BiConsumer
