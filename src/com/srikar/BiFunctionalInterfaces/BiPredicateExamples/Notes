Normal Predicate can take only one input argument and perform some conditional check.
Sometimes our programming requires to take 2 input arguments and perform some conditional check, then we go for BiPredicate.

BiPredicate is exactly same as Predicate except that it will take 2 input arguments.

 interface BiPredicate<T1,T2>  {

        public boolean test(T1 t1,T2 t2);    //remaining default methods: and(), or() , negate()

    }
