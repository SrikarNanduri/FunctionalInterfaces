Normal Consumer can take only one input argument and perform required operation and won't return any result.

But sometimes we need to accept 2 input values and perform required operation and not required to return any result. Then we go for BiConsumer.

BiConsumer is exactly same as Consumer except that it will take 2 input arguments.

 interface BiConsumer<T,U> {

      public void accept(T t,U u);     //default method andThen()

       }
