Function can take only one input argument and perform required operation and returns the result. The result need not be boolean type.

Sometimes we need to accept 2 input values and perform required operation and should return the result. Then we go for BiFunction.

BiFunction is exactly same as funtion except that it will take 2 input arguments.

 interface BiFunction<T,U,R>  {
          public R apply(T t,U u);        //default method andThen()
        }
